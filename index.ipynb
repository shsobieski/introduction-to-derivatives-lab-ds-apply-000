    "In this lab, we will practice our knowledge of derivatives. Remember that our key formula for derivatives, is \n",
    "$f'(x) = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} =  \\frac{f(x + \\Delta x) - f(x)}{\\Delta x}$.  So in driving towards this formula, we will do the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn how to represent linear and nonlinear functions in code.  \n",
    "2. Then because our calculation of a derivative relies on seeing the output at an initial value and the output at that value plus delta x, we need an `output_at` function.  \n",
    "3. Then we will be able to code the $\\Delta f$ function that sees the change in output between the initial x and that initial x plus the $\\Delta x$ \n",
    "4. Finally, we will calculate the derivative at a given x value, `derivative_at`. \n",

    "We are about to learn to take the derivative of a function in code.  But before doing so, we need to learn how to express any kind of function in code.  This way when we finally write our functions for calculating the derivative, we can use them with both linear and nonlinear functions.\n",
